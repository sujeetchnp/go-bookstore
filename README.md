# go-bookstore

This is a simple bookstore application. Little help to the go beginners who are struggling with api development. In this, we have connected database and make use of postman to udpate the database. You can see I have commented out mysql connection and used postgres. It's totally upon you which one you should go for. Thanks and Happy Coding!!
